### Introduction and Motivation
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented itself as one of the gravest global threats, and is still very much an ongoing menace.   

In equal measure, we are in the midst of the biggest vaccination campaign in human history. According to Bloomberg, >65.6 million doses in 56 countries have been administered so far (as of 25 Jan 2020), translating to a staggering 3.4 million doses daily.  

While the vaccine has offered renewed hope in the fight against COVID-19, it has also ignited aggressive anti-vaccine movements. Hence, it would be interesting to gauge the general public's perception towards COVID-19 vaccines using sentiment analysis (in Python) on recent Twitter data.
